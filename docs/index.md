# AutodidActuary Code Library

This section will document my actuarial and data science tools as they develop. Here you'll find:

- Implementation details of actuarial calculations
- Data analysis scripts and methodologies
- Code snippets and utilities
- Project architecture and design decisions

The documentation will grow alongside the codebase, providing insights into the technical aspects of the tools and resources shared on this site.

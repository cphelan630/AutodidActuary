        <h1>Book Reviews</h1>
        <p>
            A collection of books that have shaped my thinking and learning journey.
            Each entry includes my personal notes, key takeaways, and reflections.
        </p>

        <ul class="book-list">
            <li class="book-card">
                <h2 class="book-title">Thinking, Fast and Slow</h2>
                <p class="book-author">By Daniel Kahneman</p>
                <p>
                    A fascinating exploration of the two systems that drive the way we thinkâ€”System 1 
                    (fast, intuitive) and System 2 (slow, deliberate). Kahneman reveals the extraordinary 
                    capabilities and faults of fast thinking and the pervasive influence of intuitive 
                    impressions on our thoughts and behavior.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Key takeaway: Our intuitions are often unreliable, especially when dealing with 
                    statistics and probabilityâ€”subjects central to actuarial work. This book has helped 
                    me recognize cognitive biases in my own thinking and develop stronger analytical skills.

            <li class="book-card">
                <h2 class="book-title">Against the Gods: The Remarkable Story of Risk</h2>
                <p class="book-author">By Peter L. Bernstein</p>
                <p>
                    Bernstein traces the development of probability theory and risk management from ancient 
                    times to modern financial systems. The book provides an accessible history of how humans 
                    learned to understand and quantify uncertaintyâ€”the very foundation of actuarial science.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Key takeaway: The conceptual leap from viewing the future as entirely in the hands of 
                    the gods to something that could be analyzed and managed was revolutionary. This 
                    historical perspective gives context to the actuarial profession's ongoing evolution.

                <h2 class="book-title">How to Take Smart Notes</h2>
                <p class="book-author">By SÃ¶nke Ahrens</p>
                <p>
                    This book introduces the Zettelkasten method of note-taking, which emphasizes creating 
                    a network of interconnected thoughts rather than simple information storage. It's transformed 
                    how I approach learning and knowledge management.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Key takeaway: True understanding comes from making connections between ideas, not just 
                    collecting information. This system has helped me better prepare for exams and develop 
                    deeper insights across various domains of knowledge.

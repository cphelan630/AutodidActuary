Welcome to AutodidActuary, my digital garden where I share my journey through actuarial science, data analysis, and personal growth. This space will serve as a repository for my thoughts, project notes, and resources that I've found valuable in my self-directed learning path.

Here, you'll find:
- Book reviews and insights from my reading journey
- CAS exam preparation resources and tips
- Curated quotes that inspire and challenge my thinking
- YouTube clips that have shaped my understanding
- Personal thoughts on actuarial science and beyond
- A touch of comedy to keep things light

I believe in the power of self-directed learning and the importance of sharing knowledge. Through this platform, I hope to not only document my own learning journey but also provide value to others walking a similar path.

Stay tuned for regular updates as I continue to explore, learn, and share my experiences in the world of actuarial science and beyond.

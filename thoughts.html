            <h2 class="article-title">The Probabilistic Mindset: Beyond Actuarial Exams</h2>
            <p>
                One of the most valuable skills developed through actuarial training is thinking 
                probabilistically. While this is essential for pricing insurance products and 
                estimating reserves, I've found its applications extend far beyond professional 
                contexts.
            </p>
            <p>
                When we think deterministically ("this will happen" or "this won't happen"), we're 
                setting ourselves up for poor decision-making. Embracing uncertaintyâ€”assigning 
                probabilities rather than binary outcomesâ€”leads to more nuanced thinking and 
                better decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, when deciding whether to pursue additional certifications beyond my 
                actuarial designation, I've been weighing:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The probability of using those specific skills (60-70%)</li>
                <li>The likelihood of alternative paths becoming more valuable (30-40%)</li>
                <li>The distribution of potential salary increases (mean +15%, with high variance)</li>
                <li>The probability of enjoying the material enough to complete it (75%)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This probabilistic approach helps me avoid the trap of false certainty that plagues 
                many career decisions. It's a mental model I wish was taught more widely outside 
                technical fields.

            <h2 class="article-title">Learning in Public: Benefits and Challenges</h2>
            <p>
                I've recently embraced the concept of "learning in public"â€”sharing my learning 
                process rather than just the polished results. This website is part of that 
                commitment, and the experience has been transformative.
            </p>
            <p>
                The benefits have been substantial:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Deeper understanding: Explaining concepts forces clarity</li>
                <li>Accountability: Public commitments drive consistency</li>
                <li>Unexpected connections: Other learners offer perspectives I wouldn't have considered</li>
                <li>Creating value while learning: My notes help others on similar paths</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                However, there are challenges too. The fear of being wrong publicly is real, 
                especially in technical fields like actuarial science where precision matters. 
                I've had to develop comfort with saying "I'm still figuring this out" and "I might 
                be wrong about this."
            </p>
            <p>
                On balance, learning in public has accelerated my progress more than any other 
                single change to my study methods. If you're pursuing self-directed learning in 
                any field, I highly recommend giving it a try, even on a small scale.

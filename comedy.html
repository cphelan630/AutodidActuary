        <h1>Comedy</h1>
        <p>
            Because actuaries can be funny too... occasionally... with a standard deviation of humor.
        </p>

        <div class="comedy-section">
            <h2>About This Section</h2>
            <p>
                Coming soon: a collection of original stand-up clips, actuarial humor, and jokes that 
                only math nerds would understand. This page will eventually include recordings of my 
                amateur stand-up attempts and written jokes that find the humor in the seemingly dry 
                world of actuarial science.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Why Comedy?</h2>
            <p>
                Humor is a powerful way to make complex ideas more accessible and memorable. 
                As someone who spends a lot of time with mathematical concepts, finding ways to 
                communicate these ideas through humor is both challenging and rewarding.
            </p>
            <p>
                Plus, actuaries have a reputation for being... well, not the life of the party. 
                Consider this my small contribution to dispelling that stereotype.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Actuary Walks Into a Bar...</h2>
            <p>
                Here's a sample of the kind of humor you can expect in the future:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                An actuary, an underwriter, and a claims adjuster walk into a bar. The bartender says, 
                "Is this some kind of joke?" The actuary replies, "I calculate a 95% probability that it is."
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>
                Stay tuned for more intentionally nerdy humor and maybe even some recorded performances 
                once I work up the courage to do an open mic night.
            </p>

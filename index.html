        <h1>Welcome to Autodidactuary</h1>
        <p>
            Hello! I'm Connor Phelan, and this is my digital garden of self-directed learning. 
            The term "autodidactuary" combines "autodidact" (self-taught person) with "actuary" 
            (professional who analyzes risk and uncertainty) â€” representing my journey of 
            continuous learning and exploration.
        </p>
        <p>
            This site serves as both a personal knowledge repository and a public resource 
            for others interested in similar topics. Here you'll find book reviews, video clips, 
            thoughts on various subjects, actuarial exam preparation notes, inspiring quotes, 
            and even a bit of comedy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Feel free to explore, learn, and grow alongside me. The beauty of self-directed 
            learning is that it never ends â€” there's always something new to discover, 
            analyze, and understand.
        </p>
